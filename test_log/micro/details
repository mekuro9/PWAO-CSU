Test1: Latency and jitter between sending setpoint and recieving current setpoint

Test2: Bigger dataset

 Update frequency of sensor messages. ideal 100Hz but 50Hz for loop using sensor qos partly
 
 Test3:  with timer for sensor messages and 1ms timeout, no delay in loop  560hz for reliable currentState and resetflag and angleError 282hz
